# Class and id shortcuts

##### React

Not there.

##### Act

In Act you have special shortcuts for some common attributes, that are inspired
by css selectos.

Instead of class, you can do:

```js
['.todo']
```

Instead of id, you can do:

```js
['#main']
```

In the examples above, Act will render a div tag, but you can also use these
shortcuts with any other tag:

```js
['h1.title']
```
