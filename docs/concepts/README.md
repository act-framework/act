# Concepts

Act is backed by a couple of concepts that you'll have to understand to use it
fully. I totally encourage you to skip some when you begin, since you'll not
need them in the beginning or if you're building something simple. But
mastering these will certainly make you a better developer.

All concepts behind Act are not novel, they exist for a long time in the
functional programming world and they are common place in other reactive
frameworks. This means Act is supported by mature ideas on how to develop apps.
